<li>Optional: Add UITextFields for the forms so you can actually type in them and handle dismissing the keyboard. <a href="https://guides.codepath.com/ios/Registering-for-Keyboard-Events#step-6-move-uitextfield-back-when-keyboard-is-hidden">Dismissing the Keyboard</a></li>
<li><b>(Personal additions)</b>: To be able to create account, all the textfields have to be filled and write a strong password (meaning more than 4 characters). To be able to sign in, all textfields have to be filled.</li>

</ul>
<li>Optional: You should be able to swipe through the welcome screens instead of just tapping them.
</li>
</ul>

 
 
Notes:

Putting together the required tasks took less time compared to the time I spent trying to figure out how to implement few extras because I didn't want to use screenshots of UI. I tried to create the real functionality of parts of the flow, for example using UIAlertController.
